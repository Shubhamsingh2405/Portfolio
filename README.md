## 📦 Production Build

To create an optimized build for deployment:

```bash
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # (Optional) Preview the production build locally
```

This generates a static production build in the `dist/` folder, ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages (or any other static host).

## 🌟 Deploying to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages can serve the static files generated in the `dist/` folder. Make sure your repository is at `https://github.com/Shubhamsingh2405/Portfolio.git`.

### 1. Configure Vite for GitHub Pages (only if deploying to a project subpath)

If the site will be hosted at `https://Shubhamsingh2405.github.io/Portfolio/`, set the `base` option in `vite.config.mjs`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/Portfolio/',
});
```

Skip this step if you deploy to a custom domain or the root `Shubhamsingh2405.github.io`.

### 2. Build locally

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy with GitHub Actions (recommended)

1. Commit and push your code to the `main` branch of `Portfolio.git`.
2. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** and choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. Select the **"Deploy Vite"** workflow or create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - id: deploy
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

4. The workflow publishes your site automatically to `https://Shubhamsingh2405.github.io/Portfolio/` after each push.

### 4. Manual deployment alternative

If you prefer manual deployment without Actions:

```bash
npm run build
git add dist -f
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

Then set **Settings → Pages → Source** to `gh-pages` / `root`.
